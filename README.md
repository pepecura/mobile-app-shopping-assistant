* The mobile app will track your money in and money out and save all your entries in a spreadsheet automatically. You can also take a picture of your purchase and store it. 
* Then you will use your virtual assistant to ask help from your budgetbuddy chatbot for some advice on your latest spending in different categories like clothes, games etc and also about the content of your purchase eg the fabric of a new dress.

**Conversation Script** </br>
**Caller:**	Hey budgetbuddy, how much did I spend on games this month? </br>
_Agent:_ 	I have calculated that you have an inflow of  $200 and spent $242. Your 
balance is -42 dollars.  </br>
**Caller:** 	Can I buy this jacket for $30? </br>
_Agent:_	You  spent $140 on clothes this month which is $90 above your
budget for this category.  </br>
**Caller:** 	That’s alright. I still want to buy this jacket. </br>
_Agent:_ 	Ok. Can you check what fabric it is made of?  </br>
**Caller:** 	It’s made of Wool. </br>
_Agent:_ 	Wool can be a sustainable fabric depending on how it’s produced. </br>
Wool is also compostable, incredibly insulating, and doesn't shed plastic microfibers. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of animal abuse in the wool industry, and so it’s essential to vet brands to verify sourcing and production methods. While wool isn’t for everyone, it is a fabric that many sustainable brands are turning to. Look for the ZQ certification. </br>
**Caller:** 	Okay, thank you. </br>
_Agent:_ 	I am glad I was able to help. Have a great day.. </br>

</br>
**the end.**
